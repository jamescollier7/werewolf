    <h3>(Permanent Power)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The powers of the Schoolmarm, the Barber, the Scandalmonger, and the Pyromaniac have no effect on the Vagabonds.</li>
        <li>When a building is freed due to the death of its occupant, the Bailiff chooses a Vagabond of their choice. The former Vagabond receives the empty building, hands in their bindle token, and gets the power token associated with that building.</li>
        <li>A Vagabond can refuse to occupy a house offered by the Bailiff.</li>
    </ul>
