    <p>(called at night)</p>
    <p>This character can save the Villagers from the bite of the Werewolves.  Each night the Defender is called before the Werewolves.</p>
    <p>The Defender then points out a player to the Moderator. (Tradition requires the Defender to first make the symbol drawn on his card with his hand). The player thus chosen will be protected during the night (and only during that night) against the Werewolves. Even if chosen by the Werewolves, the player will not be eliminated from the game.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The Defender can protect himself. The Defender isn’t allowed to protect the same player two nights in a row. The Defender’s protection has no result on the Little Girl. (She’s having an adolescent crisis and nothing can save her from trouble). The Defender does not protect against the Piper or against the infection of the Accursed Wolf-Father.</p>
