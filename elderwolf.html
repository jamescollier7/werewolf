    <p>Each night, he wakes up and devours with the other Werewolves. But once per game, if he so wishes, after the Werewolves have fallen asleep, he raises his hand. This means that the victim isn’t devoured, but infected.</p>
    <p>The Accursed Wolf-Father can only use his special power once per game. The Moderator then touches the infected inhabitant who then immediately (and secretly) becomes a Werewolf and who will take part each night in the Werewolves’ feast. If the player had a nocturnal power, they will be woken up by the Moderator on following turns to use this power, in addition to being called with the Werewolves.</p>
