    <p>called on the first night</p>
    <p>If the Thief is in the mix, two extra Simple Villager cards must be added to those already chosen.</p>
    <p>After the characters are dealt, the two cards which haven’t been dealt are placed in the middle of the table, face-down. On the first night, the Thief will be able to take a look at these two cards, and exchange his card for one of the two others. If these cards are both Werewolves, he must exchange his card for one of these two Werewolves. He’ll play that character from now on, until the end of the game.</p>
