    <p>When the Angel is in play, the game always begins with the villageâ€™s debate followed by an elimination vote, and then the first night begins. If the Angel manages to attract the discriminatory vote of the villagers or the devouring vindictiveness of the Werewolves to be eliminated on the first turn, he will then be able to leave the nightmare a winner and win the game.</p>
    <p>In that case, the game ends: the players can then immediately begin a new game.</p>
    <p>If he fails, he becomes a Simple Villager for the rest of the game.</p>
