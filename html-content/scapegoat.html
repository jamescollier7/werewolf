    <p>If the village’s vote ends in a tie, it’s the Scapegoat who is eliminated instead of the tried character. It is up to him to work carefully to avoid such a sad fate. If the Scapegoat is eliminated, he has one last task to complete—he’ll choose who is permitted to vote or not on the next day.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Choosing only one player to vote is to risk them getting devoured by the Werewolves on the next night. There would then be no village vote. (Except, of course, if the chosen player is a Werewolf, or if the Werewolves deliberately don’t eat the chosen player…)</p>
