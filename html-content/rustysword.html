    <p>If the knight is devoured, he’s eliminated, but one of the Werewolves is contaminated by the rusted sword. Among the Werewolves guilty of that elimination, the first Werewolf to the left of the Knight with the Rusty Sword will be eliminated on the next night. This elimination due to disease will be revealed by the Moderator in the morning following the Werewolf’s disappearance. That player will have thus survived his wound for a day.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Players will be able to deduce that all the inhabitant sitting between the defunct Knight with the Rusty Sword and the sick Werewolf are innocent villagers.</p>
