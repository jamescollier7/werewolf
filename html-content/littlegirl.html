    <p>The Little Girl can, by opening her eyes a bit, spy on the Werewolves while they’re awake. If she’s caught by one of the Werewolves, she can immediately be devoured (in silence) instead of the chosen victim.</p>
    <p>The little Girl can only spy at night, when the Werewolves are awake. She’s not allowed to pass herself off as a Werewolf and open her eyes wide.</p>
