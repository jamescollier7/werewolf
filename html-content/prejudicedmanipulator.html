    <p>Before the beginning of the game, the Moderator divides the village into two groups, according to an obvious criteria (gender, glasses, size, age, etc.) and announces it out loud to the village. The Prejudiced Manipulator will of course have to be part of one of these two groups.</p>
    <p>The goal of this character is the elimination of all players of the group he hates, meaning the ones he doesn’t belong to.</p>
    <p>In that case, and only in that case, he wins the game. He has no special powers: his skill at manipulating the inhabitants of the village is his only weapon!</p>
    <p>If he gets infected by the Accursed Wolf-Father, he becomes a simple Werewolf.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> It’s not necessary to create two groups of equal size. Don’t hesitate, if necessary, to specify in front of everyone to which group each inhabitant belongs to.</p>
