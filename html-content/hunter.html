    <p>If he gets devoured by the Werewolves or unfortunately eliminated by the Villagers, the Hunter must strike back before giving up the ghost, by immediately eliminating any player of their choice.</p>
    <p><b>Special case:</b> If the Hunter is in Love with an eliminated player, before leaving the game the Hunter must immediately eliminate another player of their choice. This can create a game where there are no players left alive. In that case, none of the sides can claim victory.</p>
