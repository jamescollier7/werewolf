    <p>(called at night)</p>
    <p>At night, when called by the moderator, the Fox can choose a group of three players neighbouring each other, of whom he points to the central player. If in this group is at least one Werewolf, then the Moderator makes an affirmative sign to the Fox. In that case, the Fox will be able to use his power again on another night. If there is not a Werewolf in the chosen group, then the Fox permanently loses his power; however, he has important information, clearing the names of three players in one fell swoop.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The Moderator calls the Fox each night, but that player is not forced to use his power each night. The Fox doesn’t see the cards; the Moderator simply lets him know whether or not there’s a Werewolf among those three players.</p>
