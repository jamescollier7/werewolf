    <p>The first night (preliminary turn), he chooses two players who are in love. Cupid can, if he so wishes, choose himself as one of the two lovers.</p>
    <p>If one of the two Lovers is eliminated, the other immediately dies of sorrow. A Lover may never eliminate their loved one, nor bear them any prejudice (even if only bluffing!).</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If one of the two Lovers is a Villager and the other a Werewolf or the Piper, the goal of the game changes for the Lovers. As, in order to live out their love in peace and win the game, they must eliminate all of the other players, Werewolves and Villagers, while following the rules of the game.</p>
