    <p>At the beginning of the game, the Moderator takes the five Spiritualism cards from “New Moon” and keeps them in hand.</p>
    <p>Each night, the Moderator calls out the Gypsy and asks her if she wants to use her power. If affirmative, the Moderator reads out loud the four questions of a Spiritualism card of his choice. The Gypsy choses one of the four questions with a gesture.</p>
    <p>She then points out to the Moderator the inhabitant who will have to ask this question.</p>
    <p>The next morning, the chosen player becomes medium and asks this question out loud. With a strong otherworldly voice, the first eliminated player answers this question with a “Yessssss” or “Noooooo.”  This card is then discarded.</p>
