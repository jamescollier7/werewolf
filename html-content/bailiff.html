    <h3>(Permanent Power)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When a building is freed due to the death of its occupant, the Bailiff can choose a Vagabond of his choice. This Vagabond receives the empty building, hands in their bindle token, and gets the “power token” associated to the building if it had already been used.</li>
        <li>If, come morning, multiple buildings are free, this selection will take place for each building.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The elimination of the Bailiff will cause the end of the housing distribution. The Bailiff’s house will remain empty. The Vagabonds have thus a vested interest in protecting the Bailiff if they hope to claim a house!</p>
