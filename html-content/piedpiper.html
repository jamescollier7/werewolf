    <p>(called at night)</p>
    <p>Each night, at the Moderator's call, the Piper charms two new players. As soon as there are only charmed players left, the Piper wins the game. (Even if this happens due to a vote from the Village, or because of the Werewolves.)</p>
    <p>If infected by the Accursed Wolf-Father, he becomes a simple Werewolf. His original objective, which was to charm all players, is then abandoned. He’ll collaborate with the Werewolves to accomplish their goal for a common victory.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The Piper cannot charm himself. The Defender doesn’t protect against the charm. The Witch can’t heal the charm. The Werewolves are not immune to the charm.</p>
    <p>The charmed players all keep their powers and their characteristics. The charm isn’t transmitted between lovers.</p>
