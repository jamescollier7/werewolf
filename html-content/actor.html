    <p>(called at night)</p>
    <p>Before the game, the Moderator chooses three character cards with special abilities. After the roles have been dealt, these cards are placed face up in the middle of the table. Each night, when called by the Moderator, the Actor can choose one of these cards and use the corresponding power until the next night. If the Actor uses a character card, the Moderator removes that card from the table. It may no longer be used.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The cards offered may not be Werewolf cards.</p>
