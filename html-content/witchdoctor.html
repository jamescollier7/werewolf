    <p>She knows how to brew two extremely powerful potions: a healing potion, to resurrect the player devoured by the Werewolves, and a poison potion, used at night to eliminate a player.</p>
    <p>The Witch can use each potion <b>only once per game</b>. She can use both of her potions in the same night.</p>
    <p>In the morning, depending on the potion(s) used, there might be two players eliminated or none!</p>
    <p>The Witch can also use the healing potion for her own benefit and heal herself if she was just devoured by the Werewolves.</p>
