    <p>If the village votes against him, the Idiot flips his card over. At that moment the Villagers understand their mistake and immediately let him be. From now on, he continues to play, but may no longer vote. There will not be another vote that turn.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If the Werewolves devour him, the Idiot is eliminated. If the Idiot is eliminated while he was the Sheriff, he does not pass this function, and there will thus no longer be a Sheriff. If the Hunter shoots the Idiot, the Idiot gets eliminated.</p>
