    <h3>(Unique Power)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After any vote, the Lord can, when requested by the future victim, pardon a villager chosen by the villageâ€™s vote. The player will thus not get eliminated and will not reveal his character card.</li>
        <li>A selfish Lord can, of course, pardon himself.</li>
