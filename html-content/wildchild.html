    <p>The Wild-Child is a villager.  On the first night, when called by the Moderator, he chooses a player to be his role model.</p>
    <p>If during the game the chosen player is eliminated, the Wild-Child becomes a Werewolf and will wake up the next night with his peers, and will devour with them each night until the end of the game. However, for as long as his role model is alive, the Wild-Child remains a villager. Whether his model is a Werewolf or not changes nothing!</p>
    <p>Nothing’s keeping the Wild-child from taking part in the elimination of his role model if he so wishes. If his model is alive when all of the Werewolves have been eliminated, he wins with the villagers. If his role model is eliminated and only Werewolves survive with him, it’s also a victory for the Wild-Child.</p>
