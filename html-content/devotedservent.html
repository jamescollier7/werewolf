    <p>Before the revelation of the card of the player eliminated by the village’s vote, she can reveal herself by showing her card. In that case, the Devoted Servant loses her card, and then takes the card of the eliminated player without revealing it to anyone and takes on the role of the eliminated player until the end of the game.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, the new role taken on by the Devoted Servant sees its ability completely rest and must be played as though it was the first night. However, any possible effects previously applied to the eliminated player are cancelled.</p>
    <p>If the eliminated player was infected, in love, charmed, Sheriff, Town Crier, or Cupid, the ex-Devoted Servant isn’t.</p>
    <p>If the ex-Devoted Servant was charmed, Sheriff, or Town Crier, she no longer is.</p>
    <p>If the ex-Devoted Servant becomes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Piper:</b> the Moderator indicates to this new Piper which players were previously charmed.</li>
        <li><b>Actor</b>, <b>Town Crier</b>, or <b>Gypsy:</b> new cards aren’t dealt; only the unused ones remain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note:</b>  If she’s in love, the Devoted Servant cannot use her power. Her love is stronger than her desire to change characters.</p>
