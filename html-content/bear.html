    <p>Each morning, right after the revelation of any possible nocturnal victims, if at least one Werewolf is or ends up directly next to the Bear Tamer, then the Moderator grunts to let the players know that the Tamerâ€™s bear has smelled danger. Only players next to him and still in play are taken into account.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If the Bear Tamer is infected, then the Moderator will grunt each turn, until the Bear Tamer is eliminated.</p>
