    <h3>(Permanent &amp; Conditional Power)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Werewolves can’t devour him, and the villagers can’t vote against him.</li>
        <li>Tradition demands that he always votes before anyone else (unless he’s lost his immunity).</li>
        <li>If he votes against someone who is then eliminated (even if they’re saved before actually being eliminated), he loses his immunity and his token.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note:</b> All special powers work against him (his immunity is quite relative).</p>
