    <p>(called at night)</p>
    <p>The first night, when called by the Moderator, they wake up together and recognize each other. For experienced players, during the game, once in awhile (every other turn or at the Moderatorâ€™s discretion), they wake up again and, quickly and in silence, agree on the decisions to be taken to save the village.</p>
