    <p>Once per game, the Stuttering Judge can decide that there’ll be two consecutive votes and two subsequent eliminations. The Stuttering Judge lets the Moderator know his decision through a special sign he uses to choose an inhabitant during a village’s vote. The second vote is immediately started without any debate by the Moderator, right after the elimination caused by the first vote. The Stuttering Judge will have shown the Moderator that special sign during the first night, when called by the Moderator.</p>
